# BlueprintsEverywhere v0.1
Mod for Rimworld (Alpha 13)

Requires Community Core Library (v0.13.1.1 or greater)

Currently allows wall blueprints to be placed on stone and undiscovered cells. Colonists will build these walls if they can, however, the stone is removed before the wall is placed so prison rooms will expand wherever possible.

See [Demo.webm](https://cdn.rawgit.com/lost-RD/BlueprintsEverywhere/master/Demo.webm) for a quick video demonstration.

WARNING: modifies a class in a very lazy way in v0.1 and will probably cause issues/crashes
