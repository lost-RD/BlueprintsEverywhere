# BlueprintsEverywhere
Mod for Rimworld (Alpha 13)

Requires Community Core Library (v0.13.1.1 or greater)

Currently allows wall blueprints to be placed on stone and undiscovered cells. Colonists will build these walls if they can, however, the stone is removed before the wall is placed so prison rooms will expand wherever possible.

See Demo.webm for a quick video demonstration.
